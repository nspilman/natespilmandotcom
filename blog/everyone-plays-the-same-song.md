\------------------------------

I present, Everyone Plays the Same Song - a covers project. The way it works is simple - all participants record covers of the same song. The covers are then compiled, and we can enjoy comparing everyone's take. We'll probably post the whole thing on Soundcloud - but we'll figure that out when we get there. This is the first round. 

The purpose of this project is to promote musical education, practice and community - 

**Want to participate?**

We'll choose the song to cover sometime the week of April 20th, and set a submission deadline after that. Stay tuned.

### How Signup Works -

Signups in the song submission stage will be closing April 22nd. 

[Fill out this sign up form](https://forms.gle/nEVtvbhRt3uMKBLh9) with your name, email address and at least one and up to three songs you'd like to cover. 

### How Song Selection Works -

After song submission closes, all participants will fill out of poll with all submitted songs and their corresponding youtube links to listen to. Participants will rate the songs 1 to 5 on a scale of "Definitely don't want to cover" to "I'm super down to cover this song."  Voting a 1 vetos the song - which is a valid move if you don't see the song as technically possible for you as a musician to pull off. The survey will also include the question "In how many weeks should our cover submissions be due?"

#### Once results are in, we'll strive to make the most fair selection via the following rules -

* If there is a clear favorite that hasn't been vetoed, then that song will be chosen. 
* If there are multiple popular songs without vetos, we will randomly choose one of them. 
* If there are no obvious winners, we will discuss as participants how to move forward - allowing discussion of current submissions as well as opening the pool back up for new songs. 

  #### Vote Rubric

  | Vote | Significance                  |
  | ---- | ----------------------------- |
  | 1    | Absolutely not                |
  | 2    | I'd rather not                |
  | 3    | Sure                          |
  | 4    | I'd like to cover this        |
  | 5    | I'd REALLY like to cover this |

We'll also discuss and decide on the cover song due date based on poll results.

#### Round One submissions

**Some things I found interesting -** 

* Blinding Lights would have won if not for the veto. Its average is the same as the winner, but also has a 1 vote - which means mathematically speaking, the other votes were on average higher than the votes for bags. 
* Substitution by Silversun Pickups, Your Belgian Things by The Mountain Goats, and Circle the Drain by Soccer Mommy all averaged sub 3, but didn't receive any vetos. They were all "meh".
* Passionfruit scored about a 3, even though it had 2 vetos. 
* Sk8ter boi did surprisingly well at 2.88, even with 3 vetos. 

Thanks for being involved,\
