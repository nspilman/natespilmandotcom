I present, Everyone Plays the Same Song - a covers project. The way it works is simple - all participants record covers of the same song. The covers are then compiled, and we can enjoy comparing everyone's take. We'll probably post the whole thing on Soundcloud - but we'll figure that out when we get there. This is the first round. 

The purpose of this project is to promote musical education, practice and community -

We'll choose the song to cover sometime the week of April 20th, and set a submission deadline after that. Stay tuned.
