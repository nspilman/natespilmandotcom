Walk up to the top of the hill at Gasworks Park and enjoy the stunning views. 

## Go to the University fountain
[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Gas+Works+Park,+2101+N+Northlake+Way,+Seattle,+WA+98103/Drumheller+Fountain,+Campus+of+the+University+of+Washington,+Seattle,+WA/@47.6506241,-122.3408375,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x54901502b25bb07f:0x1e6e55abec496196!2m2!1d-122.3343532!2d47.6456308!1m5!1m1!1s0x549014ed44cb910d:0x5f7e1a3d97a7a024!2m2!1d-122.3078057!2d47.6538254!3e1?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcyMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
2 miles

Bike to the campus of the University of Washington and check out this absurdly big fountain. Feel free to bop around campus before returning to the tour route. It's a beautiful university. 

## Cross the bridge, bike Underneath 520 and end up at a cool park
[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Drumheller+Fountain,+Campus+of+the+University+of+Washington,+Seattle,+WA/47.6434882,-122.3064787/@47.644444,-122.3138158,15.13z/data=!4m9!4m8!1m5!1m1!1s0x549014ed44cb910d:0x5f7e1a3d97a7a024!2m2!1d-122.3078057!2d47.6538254!1m0!3e1?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcyMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
1 mile

When crossing over the bridge, you'll want to be on the right hand side. Cross the street at the bottom of the University mall - the google maps should guide you accordingly.

Once you cross the bridge, you'll ride along a wide sidewalk for a few blocks. Right before the entrance to highway, you'll take the path down to the right. Google is aware of this path, which is great. You'll kick out next to a nice field. 

## Bike to Interlaken Park
[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/47.6427458,-122.3071835/47.6420529,-122.3170492/@47.6375724,-122.3181285,2128m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d-122.3073164!2d47.6420506!3s0x549014c2eca2bd87:0x7b23abe214423f6a!1m0!3e1?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcyMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)

0.7 miles 

from that field, bike a few blocks through the neighborhood and bike up a decently steep road to get to the beginning of Interlaken park. You'll be biking on a road that cuts through it.
