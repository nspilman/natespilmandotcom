I shared [Scaling up EPTSS](https://natespilman.com/blog/2025-01-08-scaling-eptss) with participants and got great feedback. 

I'm thinking we need an final infrastructure phase before we are ready to under the growth phase. 
## Infra phase - 
**Website and process hardening -** 
- Document existing flows and website logic
- Automation testing 

DBC has offered to outline a QA plan, which I'd greatly appreciate. 

**Process automation -** 
- Mostly email communication 

**Updating the website to allow parallel rounds**
- Right now the round Id for round 25 is "25". This will no longer work when we have multiple rounds running at the same time. 
- Everything round associated will need to explicitly specify which round

## Growth Phase 
A concerted effort to meet other musicians who would benefit from this project with media about the project. We can develop the specifics of the media strategy collectively, as I have no specifics right now. 

Funnel interested people into a waitlist. And then run a manageable* number of rounds. 

*tbd what manageable means

So next step, I'm going to process map all my admin responsibilities to see what I can't start letting the robots do.
