I signed up for a monthly songwriting challenge. It's both the last thing I need - another thing to do - but also exactly what I need: A deadline and a group. 
It's exactly how Everyone Plays the Same Song works, except this time it's an original song. 

Writing original music - especially lyrics - makes me uncomfortable. I think it's the vulnerability of it all. That I don't feel as if I have any grounds to have something to say. Or that I do have something to say and am afraid to let it out. But now I have a deadline and an accountability group. 

I just need to check the box. I think I feel so much resistance around songwriting because each song must be immediately perfect. I know through experience that art is more often than not an intensely iterative process, but emotionally it's difficult to keep the perfectionism at bay. 

So, I just need to check the box. I need to try to write a bad song. 
That's it. I must make bad art and be free of the notion that my art must be good. And if I finish the song and it is indeed unpleasant to audiences, I will still be able to say I completed my song for the month of January. 

## Okay, so how should I do this? 
I have a bajillion Splice credits, so let me see if I can't put together an instrumental scene using Splice samples. From there, I'll write a bad song over top. 

This "writing a bad song" thing is still easier said than done. It's difficult to not care. To be intuitive without being attached to the outcome.
