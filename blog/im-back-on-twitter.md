I am at @Natetheperson on Twitter. I had posted semiregularly on twitter between 2011 and 2014, after which point I completely dropped it. 

### Reason for Jumping Back On

I noticed there was an error on the ridehome.info website, which is the website for two of my favorite podcasts - the [Techmeme Ride Home](https://www.ridehome.info/podcast/techmeme-ride-home/) and [Coronavirus Morning Report](https://www.ridehome.info/podcast/coronavirus-daily-briefing/) - and wanted to report it. The host always mentions his twitter handle for contact purposes, so I jumped back on twitter to [pass along the issue I found](https://twitter.com/Natetheperson/status/1251174080956399622?s=20). In general, it seems like a good place to post tech related questions and thoughts. 

### Revamping my Twitter

Before I could feel comfortable with my twitter account, I needed to revamp it. When I stopped using Twitter, I'd just finished working for a college marketing startup. [This is what my twitter looked like](https://web.archive.org/web/20140919070636/https://twitter.com/Natetheperson) when I logged back in. 

For the revamp I - 

1. [Archived all my old tweets](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive).
2. Used [Tweet Delete](https://tweetdelete.net) to delete all my old tweets.
3. Updated my profile and cover photos. 

And now my twitter is basically brand new! Time to unfollow all the stuff I no longer care about.
