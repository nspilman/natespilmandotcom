I'm publishing this for accountability from others and also to better see what I know and do not know. 

I was recently leant a[ XYZPrinting Da Vinci Jr 1.0 ](https://www.xyzprinting.com/en-US/product/da-vinci-jr-1-0)3d printer. 
I don't even know if this company is still in business. This could be a problem, because the printer can only use filament - the base material for the 3d output - manufactured by XYZ. There's some NFC chip situation.  XYZ claims to sell an upgrade to allow usage of 3rd party filaments - [here](https://xyzofficialweb.blob.core.windows.net/xyz-v3/download/Open_Smart_Tag.pdf)- but the actual sales link is broken. 

Basic specs about this printer - 
- It can print stuff up to 5.9 inches in each three dimensions
- Takes PLA (and variants) and PETG filament. The stock filament the printer came with is PLA, I believe. 
- 

To give you a sense of how old this printer is, the official website states that the required software is supported up to MacOS 10.14. I'm currently running MacOS 14.4.1. Obviously I hope this doesn't cause issues, but I'm installed the software and it's passed all my initial tests.
