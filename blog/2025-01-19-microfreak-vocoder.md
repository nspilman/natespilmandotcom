I saw a [lavalier microphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavalier_microphone) in the Supermarket electrics section for $7, so I thought I'd test the vocoder mode on the [Arturia Microfreak](https://www.arturia.com/products/hardware-synths/microfreak/overview). 

I followed [these instructions](https://support.arturia.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405748217746-MicroFreak-Vocoder) to some pretty quick success. 
I made this quick ditty about getting the vocoder working.

While watching the Philadelphia Eagles beat the LA Rams, I made this "The New York Giants Are In Hell Right Now" song.

Then I did some more playing around.

No one's lower than me.

In short, the Arturia Microfreak's vocoder is powerful and easy to use!! I could imagine this lavalier workflow working like, as I can sing through the main mic and pick up my voice for the vocoder with the lav mic.
