title: Utility script - move files to my NAS's /archive directory

I finally got around to writing a quick script to take better advantage of my NAS. 
https://github.com/nspilman/utilities/blob/main/move_files.go

This goes through the files on my desktop and moves them to their respective folders on my NAS based on file extension. so my `.wav` files to go `archive/music` and etc. 

Feels good to be able to create clutter and then move it to the archive when I care to. Who knows - I might automate the run!
