This blog post is written for my cousins and their two kids who are staying close to where we just stayed in Maui. I thought I'd post it on my blog, in case it comes in handy in the future. 

We used the [GuideAlong](https://guidealong.com/tour/hawaii-bundle/) app as an audioguide through our time in Hawaii, and got a lot of value out of it! You turn it on when you start driving, and it uses GPS to know when to call things out. We also learned a lot of Hawaiian history through this guide. 

## Northwest Maui (north Lahaina)
### Activities 
- The Snorkeling off of the beaches locally is fantastic. The reefs are super close, so there's no need to swim all that far out. You can rent snorkel gear from the resort, or from the many snorkel places in the area. 
	- The surf seems to get progressively rougher the farther north you go. That said, bopping around to different beaches is worth it, as each one has a different feel. 
- We did a two hour surf lessons in a small group, which was an absolute blast. Children under 9 need 1:1 lessons. 
- There are lots of Luau's in the area. I feel kind of weird about Luaus (ordering a pork plate, pouring myself some rum and watching Moana feels less exploitative), but we were with young kids, and they seemed to have a blast. 

### Shopping 
- You'll pass a big [Fruit Stand ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EmxCmbnrQq73MXy4A)on your way from the airport to the resort, a little before Lahaina. Their selection is great, though their prices are high. Like, $6 a pineapple that you could get at Times Supermarket for $1.50 level high.
- You'll be pretty close to [Times Supermarket](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XcGWWrz2cp14oKCDA), which has a bunch of great fruit and reasonable prices, as well as everything else you'd expect from a supermarket. 
-  If you're in need of what feels like a Simon Mall with beautiful beach access, [Whaler's Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wyBk12njSubhheTw5) is close by.  
- There's a [Ross](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nn5ajdm5xiJVto1y8) close by and a [Safeway](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rvh2L4NrzvSXRSJL8) across the street from it. I ended up getting a rash guard and a few polos from Ross at a very good price. 

### Dining
- In the same plaza as Time is [L&L Barbecue](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QJGSZfEPVofUVkKV8), a wonderful spot for traditional and inexpensive Hawaiian "lunch plates." Smoked pork, chicken katsu, spam musubis, etc. 
- One exit up the road from L&L and Time is the exit for [Joey's Kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PBLEvAXbSXQw4hYh7), [Fond](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rn6P3SMayNT5Mh9t5) and [The Gazebo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MxfGtWVhunAgaNBv8). Joey's and Fond are in the same commercial plaza, which also has a great supermarket and wonderful coffee shop. Both Joey's and Fond serve Hawaiian inspired fair at reasonable prices. Fond feels a little more upscale, but they're both casual. Fond takes reservations. 
- Past the plaza with Fond and Joey's is [The Gazebo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MxfGtWVhunAgaNBv8) - an incredible breakfast spot. The line for dine-in can get quite long, but there is a takeout window around back with quick turnaround. There are also tables close by where you can eat your takeout. 
- There are a few [Maui Brewing Company ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xHTCNubUBA8jwdRM8)taprooms close by. Both the beer and the food are quite good. 

## Other parts of the Island - 

### Activities 
- Near the airport is [Endangered Pieces](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Endangered+Pieces/@20.8858886,-156.4492159,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x7954d06a5782bf85:0xa1074279005e7f6a!8m2!3d20.8858886!4d-156.446641!16s%2Fg%2F1ts_6tk2?entry=ttu), a consignment store with the sign `Very Rich Dead People's Things For Sale.` It costs $2 to enter, and it's basically a museum. Good way to kill time before a flight. 
- The Road to Hana is miraculous, but may be a little rough with two young kids. You need to drive slow, and there are hundreds of switch backs and scores of single lane bridges. If you want to experience some of the drive, a good destination would be [Aunt Sandy's Banana Bread](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Aunty+Sandy's+Banana+Bread/@20.8631623,-156.1498371,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x7eab4b549b8a6841:0xbf3ccdcc961bebe8!8m2!3d20.8631623!4d-156.1472622!16s%2Fg%2F1tpps5cn?entry=ttu). The banana bread is out of this world, and it's a little less than half way through the drive.
- At the very beginning of the Road to Hana, just past Paia, is a wonderful beach with a ton of surfers. We had a blast watching the surfers do their thing for a while. 
- We didn't get a chance to visit, but we've heard good things about [Makawao](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yfVPdqWNcPrmGvCF9) - an old ranching town. Good shopping and lavender farms. 
- Another thing we didn't do but is worth calling out - visiting [Haleakala national park](https://www.nps.gov/hale/index.htm)!

### Shopping - 
- Paia has a ton of shops worth visiting, including [Maui Hands](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Maui+Hands+-+Pa'ia/@20.9156242,-156.3819812,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x184474f0d3188b37?sa=X&ved=1t:2428&ictx=111) art gallery and [Mele Ukuleles](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mele+Ukulele+Paia/@20.9157005,-156.3824201,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x7eab337d04294b41:0x2296f40e5887f163!8m2!3d20.9157005!4d-156.3815117!16s%2Fg%2F11qps2yh39?entry=ttu). 
- If you're Costco members, Costco's got a great select of Hawaiian shirts and local snacks! 

### Dining - 
- If you go to Paia, [Paia Fish Market Restaurant](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Paia+Fish+Market+Restaurant/@20.9159369,-156.3838775,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x7eab32dc26a292c3:0xcce5238665629fd8!8m2!3d20.9159369!4d-156.3813026!16s%2Fg%2F1tc_49s4?entry=ttu) is a must! 
- Also in Paia is [really good shared ice!](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nBZtHa1EmMv396qF6)
- [Colleen's at the Cannery ](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Colleen's+At+the+Cannery/@20.9134904,-156.3255838,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x7eab34998f8c9355:0xf81bea1a683e5c88!8m2!3d20.9134904!4d-156.3230089!16s%2Fg%2F1tflgf_g?entry=ttu) is in Haiku, a little past Paia. Unbelievable burgers and fish & chips (possibly the best I've ever had), as well as really good cocktails.  

Enjoy your trip!!
