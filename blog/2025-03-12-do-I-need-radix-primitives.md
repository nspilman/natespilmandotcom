I've been using Shadcn for a bit now, and I love how much UI complexity is solves. A lot of Shadcn sits on top [Radix primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives), which leads me to the ponderance - what would it look like to build a Radix primitives based library for myself. 

I'm going to start with Everyone Plays the Same Song. My plan is to use Windsurf AI to audit my current code, identify what can be standardized with a component library and kinda let it go to town. I'm sure I will have stronger guidances when truly in it. 

## Jumping in - 
In the repo for [everyoneplaysthesamesong.com](https://everyoneplaysthesamesong.com) I gave Windsurf the prompt - 
```
i would like to use Radix Primitives to revamp my whole UI. Basically, I don't want to write anything bespoke anymore, but instead have it available in my component library with Radix Primitives as the base. Do you understand me? You are allowed to push back based on your judgement.
