This is a follow up post to my latest [TODO post](https://natespilman.com/blog/2025-03-20-hella-good-cover-progress). 
I finished my Hella Good cover right at the 3/26 deadline!

I'm proud of the result!! This is round 25 of [the cover project](https://everyoneplaysthesamesong.com), and this is the most I've ever called my shot and hit it. Again, my objective for this round was to cover Hella Good by No Doubt in the style of [You'll Come Back to Jigitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztsu-RIHU10), and while there are a lot elements I didn't perfectly emulate, I think I got pretty darn close. 

I may do a more detailed write up soon - and also I might not. But at the end of the day, project based learning remains the truth.
