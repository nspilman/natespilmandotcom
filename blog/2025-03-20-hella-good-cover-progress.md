I'm *hella* pleased with the progress here after [yesterday's post](https://natespilman.com/blog/2025-03-19) .

Of the the TODOs from yesterday, these are outstanding - 
- Get fairly aggressive with reverse reverb tails between sections to keep it cohesive
- Add bridge section
- all final chorus
- Modify bass hook at the end of chorus to match what the original does

I'm not sure if I want to do the reverb tail transitions anymore. 

The next focus will be the bridge section.
I probably don't need to record any new vocals for the final chorus - copy paste what I currently have and add a vocoder effect or something. 

I also like the idea of fading the final chorus out. Basically loop "keep on dancing" forever. 

The cover itself is due next Wednesday.
