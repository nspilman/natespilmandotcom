**Some things I found interesting -** 

* Blinding Lights would have won if not for the veto. Its average is the same as the winner, but also has a 1 vote - which means mathematically speaking, the other votes were on average higher than the votes for bags. 
* Substitution by Silversun Pickups, Your Belgian Things by The Mountain Goats, and Circle the Drain by Soccer Mommy all averaged sub 3, but didn't receive any vetos. They were all "meh".
* Passionfruit scored about a 3, even though it had 2 vetos. 
* Sk8ter boi did surprisingly well at 2.88, even with 3 vetos.
