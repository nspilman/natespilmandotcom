It's been too long since I've posted something - so here's something. 
Last week I discovered the artist [Norman Zammitt](https://www.artsy.net/artist/norman-zammitt) , and I haven't been able to stop thinking about his color pallets. I made myself an [Obsidian Theme](https://docs.obsidian.md/Themes/App+themes/Build+a+theme) using colors from one of his works, and it came out decently. I'll share it in a future post. 

Anyway, that's all for now :-)
