We're about half way through round 26 of [Everyone Plays the Same Song](https://everyoneplaysthesamesong.com) , so I think it's time to break some ground. 

My initial thought was to cover the song in the style of this [Sega Bodega cover of Teenage Dirtbag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JA36857TBs), but after playing the chords on guitar a bunch, I'm going to start there. My plan is to record my playing the whole song on guitar today and then do a bunch of singing takes over it. From there, I'll get creative with the production. I don't know what that looks like yet, but that's what so fun about creative exploration. It wouldn't be exploring if I knew for sure.

I recorded a couple takes of guitar and sang over it into my iPhone to ensure I stay anchored to the different parts of the song. Next I'll record some more proper vocal takes and see where it goes from there!
