After seeing buzz for some time, I finally paused to give [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) a try. After using at it work for the week, I'm convinced that it is an elevate existence for Mac power users. 

I no longer want to do any multi-step process twice. Why would I when I now have Raycast? 

For my first trick, I am going to write myself a custom extension to make it easier to post more blog posts. I'm starting with going to Claude for some AI assistance. That didn't work much, so I'm going [to the docs!](https://developers.raycast.com/basics/create-your-first-extension)

Actually, just kidding! Extensions can only be created by Pro users, and I am not (yet) a paying customer. 

So, Scripts. I followed [this](https://www.raycast.com/blog/getting-started-with-script-commands) , with some help from Claude, to generate myself a `bash` script that commits my new blog posts to my main branch. I can now open up Raycast via `option` + `space` and type `Deploy blog`, and suddenly I have the option to do so. 

If you see this, it means it worked!
