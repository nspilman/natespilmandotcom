I put together everyoneplaysthesamesong as an excuse to engage in something with friends remotely, and to use social pressure to force me/us to practice music. 



Thanks for Google Forms and Google Sheets, the organization effort was quite simple. 

I used two Forms to get information from participants - 

* The signup / cover song submission form
* The post-submission voting form


I'm not going to get into setting up a Form itself, because it's very straightforward. What I DO want to call out some Google Forms best practices and the Google Sheets integration that's a few clicks away. 

### Google Forms best practices
- If you need to respond or send results to the people submitting for the form, make sure to include a mandatory contact information field, be in email, phone number, etc. 
- Each form field will get its own column in google sheets, so be mindful of how your data will be organized once participants have submitted their data.
