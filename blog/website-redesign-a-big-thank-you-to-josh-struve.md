I'm excited to announce that my website has gone through a redesign. I honestly don't know who actually comes to this site, but I'm excited as can be about the new look. 

I worked with a designer and front-end developer I met through the [J](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/)[unior Dev Struggle Bus meetup](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus), Josh Struve (<https://jstruve.dev/>), and it was a great experience start to finish. Josh asked some survey questions to get a feel for what I was looking for and my motivations, and then mocked up designs for the site. Josh worked incredibly quickly, and I think the whole process took a week and a half tops, from initial design review to code delivery. He has an eye for UI design and his work is clean. Josh delivered production ready html and css files. 

I'm a web developer myself, so I integrated the code into my Gridsome blog sites. I was super impressed with how easy it was to refactor my UI components into Josh's delivered html. I guess that's the benefit of having someone design around what I already had. 

Josh also redesigned [Everyoneplaysthesamesong.com](Everyoneplaysthesamesong.com), the covers project I'm involved in. 

Anyway - I just wanted to say thank you to Josh for the beautiful work, and for making the process easy, fun and exciting.
