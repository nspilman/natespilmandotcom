Hey folks - 
I'm feeling my blog post writing momentum slipping - I haven't written anything since 01-18-2024 - so this post will be about sticking to it. 

This writing practice is unlocking a different mode of thinking in me. I never spent much mind to plotting my course. I kept all in my head, jumped in and learned along the way. Now, I feel as if I've unlocked the ability to more properly prepare. I can make my life easier by organizing my thoughts beforehand. It doesn't all have to be in my head. 

So, with that in mind - here are some blog post ideas. This is a gift to my future self to lower the activation energy required to write a post. 

- Example RFCs that I've closed 
- A post on why writing RFCs is valuable 
- Examples of past RFCs
- Next Steps for Everyone Plays the Same Song 
- An outline of the projects I'm working on
- Next steps of a project I'm currently working on that is not listed above 
- Reflections from my time so far as a Springboard mentor 

Talk to you soon.
