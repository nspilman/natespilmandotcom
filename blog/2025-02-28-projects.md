I've taken white the detour over this last week or so [to explore Raycast](https://natespilman.com/blog/2025-02-21-falling-in-love-with-raycast). I think it's time to get back to work on the projects I have in the works. 

So here's a list of the personal projects I want to be wrapping up in the next month - 
- Everyone Plays the Same Song - website testing & UX hardening
- Everyone Plays the Same Song - cover of [Hella Good by No Doubt](https://everyoneplaysthesamesong.com/round/25), due at the end of March. 
- Monthly songwriting challenge - write a song a month in the year 2025. (Haven't started Feb's)

Am I missing anything? I feel like I'm missing something.

More to come.
