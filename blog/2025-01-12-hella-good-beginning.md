I started working on Hella Good for round 25 of [Everyone Plays the Same Song](everyoneplaysthesamesong.com). 

All I have to start with is the bassline and a splice sample, but I really dig it. The drums bring the energy up higher than the original naturally. We'll see if that's what I'll be going for, but I'm enjoying experimenting early.
