The voting phase is a time of excitement and opportunity. We have our cover candidate playlist - a banger of a playlist, as our participants have good taste - any of one of these songs could be the song for the round. But how, you may ask, do I confidently vote on the fates of these lovely songs? This article will give you some ideas. 

First off, there are no rules! If you hate every song, give them all 1s. Love every song? Give them all 5s. There are different motivations around voting for each song. Here are a few common motivations—do any of these resonate with you?

### 1. "I Want the Song I Submitted to Win"

You're invested in your own submission and hope it takes the crown. Naturally, you're excited to champion your choice and see it become the round's featured track.

### 2. "I Already Have a Style in Mind for My Cover"

You've envisioned the style or mood you want to explore, and certain songs perfectly match that vision. Your votes are influenced by how well songs align with your creative plans.

### 3. "There Are Interesting (or Not Interesting) Elements to This Song"

You focus on the uniqueness and intriguing components of each song. If something innovative or particularly captivating catches your ear, it scores higher in your book.

### 4. "This Song Would Be a Challenge"

You consider the difficulty level when voting. Maybe you're excited about pushing your boundaries with a challenging cover, or perhaps you're looking for something easier this round.

### 5. "I Vibe (or Don't Vibe) with This Song"

Sometimes, it all boils down to the simple question of personal connection. Does the song resonate with you emotionally, rhythmically, or melodically? If yes, high marks. If not, perhaps a lower score.

### Vote Your Way!

Whatever your motivation, the beauty of the voting phase is your freedom to express what matters most to you. Each vote helps shape the journey of our musical round.

So, what motivates your voting? Dive in and cast your scores—your playlist awaits!
