Hey y'all - I'm writing again! 

This definitely smells of a new years resolution (derogatory), but I mean it (we'll see). I think I stopped writing because I starting putting too much importance on what I thought folks wanted to read. Instead, I'm going to write about what I'm personally interested in learning and exploring. 

Also, my [bsky account](https://bsky.app/profile/natespilman.com) is my domain, so maybe it shouldn't be a dormant place? 

More to come.
