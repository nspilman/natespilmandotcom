I live in Seattle - but in a different neighborhood than the one that's been making national headlines. Per [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill_Autonomous_Zone) about the Chaz, after tension escalated between protestors and officers, the Seattle Police Department "retreated" from the East Precinct building in an act of good will to the protestors. This three-ish block zone has become known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, or "CHAZ." There's been a lot of misinformation spreading about CHAZ - that there were large men with machine guns charging admission, or that local businesses were being shaken down, so I went to go check it out myself. 

I'm going to start with my overall thoughts, share some photos and then go over some specifics.

Overall, it was nothing to be afraid of. There were no weapons - just folks taking a peaceful stand. I was there in the morning on a Friday. I[n the 3 blocks and a park that make up CHAZ](https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capitol_Hill_Autonomous_Zone.jpg?quality=65&strip=all), there were - 

* two medical tents
* The No-Cop Co-Op, serving free coffee, aggregating and providing necessary resources. 
* Places to get free food. 
* A sausage stand where you can pay for a sausage. 



The Zone was lit up with artwork, starting with the enormous Black Lives Matter mural on the pavement. The police station was straight up vandalized. Regardless of how this ends, I hope the art remains. 



Regarding the politics of it all - almost I spoke with expected to see the Zone used as a bargaining chip with the city for greater police reform measures. Most of the people at CHAZ were white. [Seattle is 65% white and only 7% black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Seattle#:~:text=The%20racial%20composition%20of%20the,or%20Latino%20of%20any%20race.), but there were still some vibes that CHAZ was a way for white folks to co-opt a black movement (more on this later). I also encountered an older white man who kept trying to vandalize the police station even further, with a black male in his 20s standing guard against his efforts. 



Without further ado, here are some photos.
