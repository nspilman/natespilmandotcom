I live in Seattle - but in a different neighborhood than the one that's been making national headlines. Per [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill_Autonomous_Zone) about the Chaz, after tension escalated between protestors and officers, the Seattle Police Department "retreated" from the East Precinct building in an act of good will to the protestors. This three-ish block zone has become known as the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, or "CHAZ." There's been a lot of misinformation spreading about CHAZ - that there were large men with machine guns charging admission, or that local businesses were being shaken down, so I went to go check it out myself. 

I'm going to start with my overall thoughts, share some photos and then go over some specifics.

Overall, it was nothing to be afraid of. There were no weapons - just folks taking a peaceful stand. I was there in the morning on a Friday. I[n the 3 blocks and a park that make up CHAZ](https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capitol_Hill_Autonomous_Zone.jpg?quality=65&strip=all), there were - 

* two medical tents
* The No-Cop Co-Op, serving free coffee, aggregating and providing necessary resources. 
* Places to get free food. 
* A sausage stand where you can pay for a sausage. 

Most businesses in the area were already closed due to covid, and the businesses that were open were still in full operation. I saw a couple waiting outside the Eltana for their order. 

The Zone was lit up with artwork, starting with the enormous Black Lives Matter mural on the pavement. The police station was straight up vandalized. Regardless of how this ends, I hope the art remains. 

Regarding the politics of it all - almost I spoke with expected to see the Zone used as a bargaining chip with the city for greater police reform measures. Most of the people at CHAZ were white. [Seattle is 65% white and only 7% black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Seattle#:~:text=The%20racial%20composition%20of%20the,or%20Latino%20of%20any%20race.), but there were still some vibes that CHAZ was a way for white folks to co-opt a black movement (more on this later). I also encountered an older white man who kept trying to vandalize the police station even further, with a black male in his 20s standing guard against his efforts. 

Without further ado, here are some photos.

As for the Police Station -

### Interactions with others -

I bought a sausage from the sausage guy from Kenya, and we discussed the Swahili language.  (*asante sana* means *thank you very much* in Swahali)

I then walked around taking photos, and overheard a conversation by one of the medical tents. There was a black woman asking the members of the Medical tent - all white - who was in charge and what the demands were to tear down the CHAZ barriers. They responded along the lines of "There is no leader, no organizer. We are but Medics. You'll have to talk to someone else about demands and organization, but remember, there is no leader." One of the guys was fairly rude. 

I spoke with this woman after the conversation, indicating that I appreciated her inquiry of basically "now what?" for the CHAZ movement. It was also interesting to hear the opinion of a black woman at a zone organized (or not organized?) around the idea that Black Lives Matter. 

I followed this woman in the direction of the No Cop Co-Op where she was going to ask similar questions when she stopped half way to ask a black volunteer in a tent outside the precinct. Here's the scene below - with blurred faces to respect their privacy.

The conversation between the two more or less boiled down to - 

The woman indicated that she was in LA during the race riots and Johannesburg during the end of Apartheid. The argued that real progress would need to be made via identifying a list of demands, and was concerned that CHAZ appeared leaderless. She was also concerned that   CHAZ was a distraction from the good work that BLM is doing, and that it was largely co-opted by white people.  The protestor argued that although there was no top-down leadership in place, moves were being made with people in power in Seattle - and that while the there were a ton of white people around at CHAZ, it was 11am on a Friday, and not indicative of the area during an organized protest. 

At this point at small crowd had form - all white - including a man running for Congress, and an older gentleman who told me he "needed to spraypaint the windows of the police station black so when Trump orders the cops back, they can't see outside." Crazy Anarchist Man is an example of a white person co-opting the movement. I soon after learned that our protestor friend was in his tent outside the precinct explicitly to play defense against Crazy Anarchist Man. When it was suggested "We need a leader to present demands" Crazy Anarchist Man responds that leaders were the problem. 

A third black person showed up - appearing in his early 20s (but who can tell with the masks) - who shared in the opinion that the whole CHAZ project was another example of white people running away with their movement. Pretty soon there must have been a crowd of at least ten white folks listening to these three black folks speak. At one point a white lady in the crowd cut off the black woman mid-sentence to say "I just want to let you know that I'm listening to you." completely missing the tragic irony of her statement. "I'm here so I can broaden my experience and bring it back to my racist family members."  

The younger black man responds "No disrespect but I don't need white people to like me. You can hate me as much as you want as long as I know my rights." 

The black woman's main point was "We need to take down the barriers, as barriers represent what black people have been running up against for years. The barriers are offensive. Taking down the barriers should be seen as an olive branch to the Seattle police department to make meaningful change happen." The protestor responded that he and other black protestors saw the barriers as necessary to keep the violent police out, and not as a reminder of their oppression. 

Near the end of the conversation, the black woman pointed to a "BLM" tag behind a chain linked fence and indicated how awful of an image that was. A white guy in the crowd yells "Then let's replace it with art!" to which she responds "How will that help black people?"
