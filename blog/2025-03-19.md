I don't have much time left to finish my cover. I'm pleased with where I'm at so far, and have been able to follow [my original plan](https://natespilman.com/blog/2025-03-01-hella-good-cover-plan) if covering the song in what I call a "hyperhouse" style.

Outstanding stuff - 
- An intro. I can keep it minimal or I can make it big and allude to the chorus
- Record vocals 
- Definitely do some effects work on the vocals. Pitching up an octave? 
- Get fairly aggressive with reverse reverb tails between sections to keep it cohesive
- Add bridge section
- all final chorus
- Modify bass hook at the end of chorus to match what the original does
