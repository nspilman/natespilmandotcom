Toneway is a duo - Jon Soifer and Nate Spilman. We're learning as we go, and having a blast doing it.

## About the song -

After finishing our first Toneway song, Let It Ride, Nate brought an instrumental demo to Jon that he'd put together a few months prior - originally called "The Breakdown." About a month in, "The Breakdown" was almost done. about 6 months later, "Falling" hits streaming platforms on 3/8.

### Labor was generally divided as follows -

- Nate wrote most of the lyrics, but entirely with Jon in the room as a sounding board. There was a ton of garbage that didn't make the final cut.
- Nate performed the vocals, with Jon on all the instruments.
- Jon owned the Ableton live session once we began working on it as a Toneway song. Nate would "get in there" every once in a while to make some minor updates.
- Legend will tell that Jon cranked out the synth solo after the second chorus completely improvised in a single take. Legend will be right.
- Jon mixed and mastered the track.
- Nate built the marketing website, and owns the instagram.
- Nate made the promotional artwork and album art, with many iterations of feedback with Jon.
