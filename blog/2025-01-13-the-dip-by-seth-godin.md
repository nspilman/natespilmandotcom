Seth Godin has a way to get to the point. 
The Dip teaches that greatness is on the other side of the dip, and it can take a life's work to power through the dip to the other side. But with this knowledge, it's imperative to be working only on the Dip that I can achieve, and quit all else. 

The self reflection here is that I collect new endeavors, as the initial part is easy and exciting. And then when i hit the dip, I pivot to something new and fun. But I never cut the old endeavor. 

I could afford to quit things.
