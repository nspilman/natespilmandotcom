# Setting Up Gmail API Testing: A Windsurf-Guided Journey

I recently needed to set up email testing for my application's magic link authentication. Instead of figuring it out alone, I paired with Windsurf, an AI-powered IDE, to get it done in about an hour. Here's how it went.

## The Problem

I needed to:

1. Send test emails with magic links
2. Read those emails back programmatically
3. Make it work in my CI/CD pipeline

## First Try: SMTP (It Failed)

Windsurf first suggested using Nodemailer with Gmail's SMTP server. We set it up, but kept hitting authentication errors. Even with valid OAuth2 credentials, Gmail's SMTP server wasn't happy. After a few attempts, Windsurf suggested we try a different approach.

## The Solution: Direct Gmail API

The breakthrough came when Windsurf recommended switching to the Gmail API directly. The code ended up being surprisingly simple:

typescript

CopyInsert

`const gmail = google.gmail({ version: 'v1', auth: oauth2Client }); // Send an email await gmail.users.messages.send({   userId: 'me',   requestBody: { raw: emailContent } }); // Read it back const messages = await gmail.users.messages.list({   userId: 'me',   q: 'subject:"Test Magic Link"' });`

## OAuth2 Setup: The Tricky Part

The most confusing part was OAuth2 setup. Windsurf guided me through:

1. Creating credentials in Google Cloud Console
2. Running a one-time authorization flow to get a refresh token
3. Storing that token in my `.env` file

What's cool is that the refresh token lasts basically forever (as long as you use it every 6 months), so I only had to do this setup once.

## Debugging Together

We hit a few snags along the way:

1. First, a redirect URI mismatch (turned out case-sensitivity matters!)
2. Then some issues with email headers being undefined
3. Finally, some base64 decoding quirks

Each time, Windsurf suggested fixes and explained what was happening. The error messages went from cryptic OAuth errors to a working email flow.

## The Final Script

The end result is a TypeScript script that:

1. Sends a test email with a magic link
2. Waits a moment
3. Reads it back
4. Displays all the email details and extracts the magic link

All the OAuth complexity is handled behind the scenes, and it just works.

## What I Learned

1. The Gmail API is actually easier than SMTP for testing
2. OAuth2 setup is confusing but only needs to be done once
3. Having an AI coding partner makes API integration way less painful

The whole thing took about an hour, and most of that time was just me following Windsurf's suggestions and fixing things when they didn't work quite right. If you're setting up something similar, I'd definitely recommend letting an AI guide you through it - it beats digging through Stack Overflow posts and API docs any day!
