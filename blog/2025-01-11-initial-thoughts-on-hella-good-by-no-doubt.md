I have to cover Hella Good by No Doubt for round 25 of [Everyone Plays the Same Song](https://everyoneplaysthesamesong.com/). I'm going to use this post to write out things I learn and find interesting. 

I'm reading through [the wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hella_Good), and I'm struck to learn that Hella Good is off their fifth studio album. I know No Doubt had been around a while, but as someone who really only knows No Doubt's hits, it's a cool reminder. 

The song came out in March 11, 2002, and of course brain immediately went "wow, nine eleven just happened". 

Pharrell is credited as one of the songwriters, because of course he is. I know he did the Hollaback Girl beat, and there are a lot of similarities between the two. The similarities are mostly in the sound choices - choices I would never make myself. But that's why Pharrell is Pharrell. 

I don't think Pharrell did the beat himself though, because the song doesn't start with his 4 x sample loop signature thing. 

I think this is going to be another round where I focus on synths, digital or physical.
