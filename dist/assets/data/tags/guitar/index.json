Any note in the chromatic scale (aka, all notes) is either in or not in the G Major Scale. Different scales can share notes, but there are no two scales that have the same notes. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these above truths in mind, I'm trying to up my fluency in playing the same scale anywhere on the guitar. What I expect as a result of this practice is for my fingers to to have a profoundly clearer sense of -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where they are in relation to the scale as a whole.</li>\n<li>How to get to where they want to go next.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-practice-routine\"><a href=\"#the-practice-routine\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The Practice Routine</h3>\n<p>With that, I'm using <a href=\"https://www.guitarscientist.com/generator/pic/showpic.php?frb=KoAFAPAyfenQw5I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this</a> document as a way to practice. My routine is to listen to songs I enjoy in G Major or Em (the relative minor of G Major) and improvise vertically (as in, not moving my hand up or down the neck), and then incrementally move up frets (up the neck) while maintaining the same scale.</p>\n"}}]}},"allTag":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"beer","path":"/tags/beer/"}},{"node":{"id":"Notes","path":"/tags/Notes/"}},{"node":{"id":"vue.js","path":"/tags/vue.js/"}},{"node":{"id":"namecheap","path":"/tags/namecheap/"}},{"node":{"id":"netlifycms","path":"/tags/netlifycms/"}},{"node":{"id":"Netlify","path":"/tags/Netlify/"}},{"node":{"id":"meta","path":"/tags/meta/"}},{"node":{"id":"javascript","path":"/tags/javascript/"}},{"node":{"id":"CHOP","path":"/tags/CHOP/"}},{"node":{"id":"protest","path":"/tags/protest/"}},{"node":{"id":"BLM","path":"/tags/BLM/"}},{"node":{"id":"seattle","path":"/tags/seattle/"}},{"node":{"id":"test","path":"/tags/test/"}},{"node":{"id":"a multi-word tag","path":"/tags/a%20multi-word%20tag/"}},{"node":{"id":"singlewordtag","path":"/tags/singlewordtag/"}},{"node":{"id":"Everyone Plays the Same Song","path":"/tags/Everyone%20Plays%20the%20Same%20Song/"}},{"node":{"id":"Google Sheets","path":"/tags/Google%20Sheets/"}},{"node":{"id":"Google Forms","path":"/tags/Google%20Forms/"}},{"node":{"id":"education","path":"/tags/education/"}},{"node":{"id":"pillow","path":"/tags/pillow/"}},{"node":{"id":"data science","path":"/tags/data%20science/"}},{"node":{"id":"histogram","path":"/tags/histogram/"}},{"node":{"id":"matplotlib","path":"/tags/matplotlib/"}},{"node":{"id":"update","path":"/tags/update/"}},{"node":{"id":"misc","path":"/tags/misc/"}},{"node":{"id":"twitter","path":"/tags/twitter/"}},{"node":{"id":"guitar","path":"/tags/guitar/"}},{"node":{"id":"everyone plays the same song","path":"/tags/everyone%20plays%20the%20same%20song/"}},{"node":{"id":"organizing","path":"/tags/organizing/"}},{"node":{"id":"projects","path":"/tags/projects/"}},{"node":{"id":"creative","path":"/tags/creative/"}},{"node":{"id":"covers","path":"/tags/covers/"}},{"node":{"id":"career","path":"/tags/career/"}},{"node":{"id":"tech","path":"/tags/tech/"}},{"node":{"id":"software","path":"/tags/software/"}},{"node":{"id":"mido","path":"/tags/mido/"}},{"node":{"id":"midi","path":"/tags/midi/"}},{"node":{"id":"music","path":"/tags/music/"}},{"node":{"id":"python","path":"/tags/python/"}},{"node":{"id":"building the blog","path":"/tags/building%20the%20blog/"}},{"node":{"id":"graphql","path":"/tags/graphql/"}},{"node":{"id":"Gridsome","path":"/tags/Gridsome/"}},{"node":{"id":"Software","path":"/tags/Software/"}},{"node":{"id":"Meta","path":"/tags/Meta/"}}]}},"context":{}}
