June 2020","content":"<p><em>This post makes reference to <a href=\"https://natespilman.com/blog/my-time-at-chaz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">part 1</a></em> </p>\n<p>I went back to CHOP on Sunday June 15. I'm going to highlight my key takeaways and experiences and let the photos do the rest of the talking. </p>\n<p>There were way more people out and about at CHOP at noon on a Sunday than at 11 on a Friday. It felt like a summer festival, but with Black Lives Matter as the central theme.  There was a bubble blowing man, a jazz bluegrass band and a guy selling Black Lives Matter shirts and masks. The police precinct had a few new signs and looked a lot more put together. There was an Indigenous People's display telling Washington governor Inslee to defund fossil fuel projects. </p>\n<p>I spotted Shirley - the black woman from the previous post who was concerned about lack of BLM organization at CHOP - organizing a workshop with a large group of black folks to identify mission and message. James from the previous post was also assisting in the organization. The workshop was considered \"Private\" and positioned itself down a long alleyway, since technically all of CHOP is out in the open. I spoke with the volunteers guarding the entrance - one of them with a James Baldwin novel on his lap - and experienced the following. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A young white man was visibly angry. His black friend showed up, and per their conversation: someone was a jerk to the black guy, the white guy wanted to defend his friend and fight the guy, while the black friend wanted nothing to do with it. The white guy continued defending his rage and justification of violence in defense of his friend. I confirmed with the black volunteer that we just witnessed an example of a white ally wanting to help but not actually listening to the black person/people he's trying to help. </li>\n<li>An older white man exited the alley, appearing to have just walked through the workshop. He yelled a few swear words and gave them the middle finger before leaving the alley. Fortunately I didn't hear any racial slurs. </li>\n<li>Another older white man with an impressive zoom lens lined up in front of the alley to take photos of the workshop. For the safety of the volunteers, everyone in the area informed this man that this event was private and he shouldn't be taking photos. He responded, without putting his camera down, that this is \"public property and therefore this is his right.\" I stepped in front of his lens and said while this is true, we are respectfully asking him not to engage in this behavior. He responded by saying that we were infringing on his constitutional rights, and that we were all hypocrites for fighting for \"The very rights that you are now stripping me of.\" I asked him that if he did take any photos, to please blur out the faces. He responds \"Why do you think I'd listen to anything you have to say to me?\" </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also spoke with one of the volunteers of the No Cop Co-Op. I asked him how he got involved, and he said he showed up the day before and asked how he could help. He'd been working ever since, as he worked the night watch through the night, and was now making tomato soup for people. He also made reference to a person - \"Mama\" - who was a figure of authority. \"Mama told me to take watch of the co-op to ensure there wasn't any looting.\" I hope he's gotten some rest. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/chopBusiness1.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chopBusiness2.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chopBus3.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop1.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop2.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop3.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop4.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop5.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop6.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop7.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop8.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop9.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop10.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop11.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop12.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop13.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop14.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop15.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop16.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop17.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop18.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop19.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop20.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chop21.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Now that the work week is back upon us, I probably won't be returning to CHOP until next weekend. I hope it remains the self-sustaining pro-social community it's become. I hope black organizers are able to seize the narrative and drive lasting social change. </p>\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"My time at CHAZ/CHOP","path":"/blog/my-time-at-chaz/","description":"Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone / Occupied Protest - Friday June 12 from 10:00 to 11:30AM","tags":[{"title":"seattle"},{"title":"BLM"},{"title":"protest"},{"title":"CHOP"}],"date":"13. June 2020","content":"<p><em>Note: Right before I published this, CHAZ changed its name to CHOP - Capitol Hill Occupied Protest. I'm going to leave the references to CHAZ in the original piece, but recognize the recent name change.</em> </p>\n<p>I live in Seattle - but in a different neighborhood than the one that's been making national headlines as an Autonomous Zone. Per <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill_Autonomous_Zone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this wikipedia article</a> about CHAZ(Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone), after tension escalated between protestors and officers, the Seattle Police Department \"retreated\" from the East Precinct building in an act of good will to the protestors. This four-ish block zone has become known as CHAZ. There's been a lot of misinformation spreading about CHAZ - that there were large men with machine guns charging admission, or that local businesses were being shaken down, so I went to go check it out myself. </p>\n<p>I'm going to start with my overall thoughts, share some photos and then go over some specifics.</p>\n<p>Overall, there was nothing to fear. There were no weapons - just folks taking a peaceful stand. I was there on a Friday morning. I<a href=\"https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capitol_Hill_Autonomous_Zone.jpg?quality=65&#x26;strip=all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">n the 4 blocks and a park that make up CHAZ</a>, there were - </p>\n<ul>\n<li>two medical tents</li>\n<li>The No-Cop Co-Op, serving free coffee, aggregating and providing necessary resources. </li>\n<li>Places to get free food. </li>\n<li>A sausage stand where you can buy a sausage. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most businesses in the area were already closed due to Covid, and the businesses that were open were still in full operation. I saw a couple waiting outside a bagel shop for their order. </p>\n<p>The Zone was lit up with artwork, starting with the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylekotajarvi/status/1271317000313167872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">enormous Black Lives Matter mural</a> on the pavement. The police station was boarded up and covered in graffiti. Regardless of how this ends, I hope the art remains. </p>\n<p>Most of the people at CHAZ were white. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Seattle#:~:text=The%20racial%20composition%20of%20the,or%20Latino%20of%20any%20race.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Seattle is 65% white and only 7% black</a>, but there were still some vibes that CHAZ was a way for white folks to co-opt a black movement (more on this later). I also encountered an older white man who kept trying to vandalize the police station even further, with a black male in his 20s standing guard against his efforts. </p>\n<p>Without further ado, here are some photos. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/5d188203-9817-4d0e-9f36-0b1a498ca6f4.jpeg\" alt=\"enterChaz\" title=\"enterChaz\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/chaz_38.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/chaz_12.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chaz_3.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chaz_4.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chaz_16.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chaz_19.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/3df6bdca-747d-43a3-9bfe-139b636bde54.jpeg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/32a9bf48-cab8-4c95-a1b8-2a0c0c0b974a.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>As for the Police Station - </p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/chaz_7.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chaz_10.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chaz_31.jpg\"> <img src=\"/uploads/chaz_37.jpg\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"interactions-with-others--\"><a href=\"#interactions-with-others--\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Interactions with others -</h3>\n<p>I bought a sausage from the sausage guy from Kenya, and we discussed the Swahili language.  (<em>asante sana</em> means <em>thank you very much</em> in Swahali)</p>\n<p>I then walked around taking photos, and overheard a conversation by one of the medical tents. There was a black woman asking the members of the medical tent - all white - who was in charge and what the demands were to tear down the CHAZ barriers. They responded along the lines of \"There is no leader, no organizer. We are but medics. You'll have to talk to someone else about demands and organization, but remember, there is no leader.\" One of the guys was fairly rude. </p>\n<p>I spoke with this woman after the conversation, indicating that I appreciated her inquiry of basically \"now what?\" for the CHAZ movement. It was also interesting to hear the opinion of a black woman at a zone organized (or not organized?) around the idea that Black Lives Matter. </p>\n<p>I followed this woman in the direction of the No Cop Co-Op where she was going to ask similar questions when she stopped halfway to start up a conversation with a black volunteer in a tent outside the precinct. Here's the scene below - with blurred faces to respect their privacy. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/uploads/chaz_21.jpg\"></p>\n<p>To make it easier to follow along, I'm going to call the black woman <a href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/the-undefeated-44-most-influential-black-americans-in-history/#shirley-chisholm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Shirley</a> and the protestor <a href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/the-undefeated-44-most-influential-black-americans-in-history/#james-baldwin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">James</a>.  </p>\n<p>The conversation between the two more or less boiled down to - </p>\n<p>Shirley indicated that she was in LA during the race riots and Johannesburg during the end of Apartheid. She argued that real progress would need to be made via identifying a list of demands, and was concerned that CHAZ appeared leaderless. She was also concerned that   CHAZ was a distraction from the good work that BLM is doing, and that it was largely co-opted by white people.  James argued that although there was no top-down leadership in place, moves were being made with people in power in Seattle - and that while the there were a ton of white people around at CHAZ, it was 11am on a Friday, and not indicative of the area during an organized protest. </p>\n<p>At this point at small crowd had formed - all white - including an ally of the black community running for Congress, and an older gentleman who told me he \"needed to spraypaint the windows of the police station black so when Trump orders the cops back, they can't see outside.\" Crazy Anarchist Man is an example of a white person co-opting the movement. I soon after learned that James was in his tent outside the precinct explicitly to play defense against Crazy Anarchist Man. When it was suggested \"We need a leader to present demands\" Crazy Anarchist Man responds that leaders were the problem. </p>\n<p>A third black person showed up - we'll call him <a href=\"https://theundefeated.com/features/the-undefeated-44-most-influential-black-americans-in-history/#jesse-owens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Jesse</a>. Jesse appeared to be in his early 20s (but who can tell with the masks), and shared in the opinion that the whole CHAZ project was another example of white people running away with their movement. Pretty soon there must have been a crowd of at least ten white folks listening to these three black folks speak. At one point a white lady in the crowd cut off the black woman mid-sentence to say \"I just want to let you know that I'm listening to you.\" completely missing the tragic irony of her statement. \"I'm here so I can broaden my experience and bring it back to my racist family members.\"  </p>\n<p>Jesse responds \"No disrespect but I don't need white people to like me. You can hate me as much as you want as long as I know my rights.\" </p>\n<p>Shirley's main point was \"We need to take down the barriers, as barriers represent what black people have been running up against for years. The barriers are offensive. Taking down the barriers should be seen as an olive branch to the Seattle police department to make meaningful change happen.\" James responded that he and other black protestors saw the barriers as necessary to keep the violent police out, and not as a reminder of their oppression. </p>\n<p>Near the end of the conversation, Shirley pointed to a \"BLM\" tag behind a chain linked fence and indicated how awful of an image that was. A white guy in the crowd yells \"Then let's replace it with art!\" to which she responds \"How will that help black people?\"</p>\n<p>The conversation luls for a moment as we stop and watch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MayorJenny/status/1271533580011753472\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan walk by</a>, which I counted as points for James' argument that the powerful people are talking to the powerful people.</p>\n<h3 id=\"parting-notes--\"><a href=\"#parting-notes--\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Parting notes -</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CHAZ is not the unruly anarchist state that some are portraying it as, but it's seen to some as a distraction from the core BLM movement. </li>\n<li>Speaking of which - don't let this blogpost distract you from the fact <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/thousands-march-in-seattle-in-silence-to-show-support-of-black-lives/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">that 60,000 people took part in the 1.8-mile March of Silence</a> later that day, Friday June 12 in support of Black Lives Matter. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Omarisal/status/1271923987962949632\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">There are black focused events happening at CHAZ</a> - just maybe not at 11am on a Friday. </li>\n<li>All the news reports I've seen only show the precinct and none of the beautiful artwork around it. They're trying to make it scarier than it is. </li>\n<li>Whether CHAZ becomes Seattle's <a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/europe/denmark/articles/christiania-13-things-to-know-about-copenhagens-hippie-free-town/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Christiania</a> or is disbanded, I hope the artwork remains. I hope the resolution is non-violent. I hope CHAZ is turning the dial toward social justice. </li>\n<li>Whatever we do to make things better for black and people of color - let's make sure we're doing it by listening to black and people of color. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p>\n"}}]}},"allTag":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"beer","path":"/tags/beer/"}},{"node":{"id":"Notes","path":"/tags/Notes/"}},{"node":{"id":"vue.js","path":"/tags/vue.js/"}},{"node":{"id":"namecheap","path":"/tags/namecheap/"}},{"node":{"id":"netlifycms","path":"/tags/netlifycms/"}},{"node":{"id":"Netlify","path":"/tags/Netlify/"}},{"node":{"id":"meta","path":"/tags/meta/"}},{"node":{"id":"javascript","path":"/tags/javascript/"}},{"node":{"id":"CHOP","path":"/tags/CHOP/"}},{"node":{"id":"protest","path":"/tags/protest/"}},{"node":{"id":"BLM","path":"/tags/BLM/"}},{"node":{"id":"seattle","path":"/tags/seattle/"}},{"node":{"id":"test","path":"/tags/test/"}},{"node":{"id":"a multi-word tag","path":"/tags/a%20multi-word%20tag/"}},{"node":{"id":"singlewordtag","path":"/tags/singlewordtag/"}},{"node":{"id":"Everyone Plays the Same Song","path":"/tags/Everyone%20Plays%20the%20Same%20Song/"}},{"node":{"id":"Google Sheets","path":"/tags/Google%20Sheets/"}},{"node":{"id":"Google Forms","path":"/tags/Google%20Forms/"}},{"node":{"id":"education","path":"/tags/education/"}},{"node":{"id":"pillow","path":"/tags/pillow/"}},{"node":{"id":"data science","path":"/tags/data%20science/"}},{"node":{"id":"histogram","path":"/tags/histogram/"}},{"node":{"id":"matplotlib","path":"/tags/matplotlib/"}},{"node":{"id":"update","path":"/tags/update/"}},{"node":{"id":"misc","path":"/tags/misc/"}},{"node":{"id":"twitter","path":"/tags/twitter/"}},{"node":{"id":"guitar","path":"/tags/guitar/"}},{"node":{"id":"everyone plays the same song","path":"/tags/everyone%20plays%20the%20same%20song/"}},{"node":{"id":"organizing","path":"/tags/organizing/"}},{"node":{"id":"projects","path":"/tags/projects/"}},{"node":{"id":"creative","path":"/tags/creative/"}},{"node":{"id":"covers","path":"/tags/covers/"}},{"node":{"id":"career","path":"/tags/career/"}},{"node":{"id":"tech","path":"/tags/tech/"}},{"node":{"id":"software","path":"/tags/software/"}},{"node":{"id":"mido","path":"/tags/mido/"}},{"node":{"id":"midi","path":"/tags/midi/"}},{"node":{"id":"music","path":"/tags/music/"}},{"node":{"id":"python","path":"/tags/python/"}},{"node":{"id":"building the blog","path":"/tags/building%20the%20blog/"}},{"node":{"id":"graphql","path":"/tags/graphql/"}},{"node":{"id":"Gridsome","path":"/tags/Gridsome/"}},{"node":{"id":"Software","path":"/tags/Software/"}},{"node":{"id":"Meta","path":"/tags/Meta/"}}]}},"context":{}}
