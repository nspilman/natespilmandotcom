Any note in the chromatic scale (aka, all notes) is either in or not in the G Major Scale. Different scales can share notes, but there are no two scales that have the same notes. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these above truths in mind, I'm trying to up my fluency in playing the same scale anywhere on the guitar. What I expect as a result of this practice is for my fingers to to have a profoundly clearer sense of -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where they are in relation to the scale as a whole.</li>\n<li>How to get to where they want to go next.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-practice-routine\"><a href=\"#the-practice-routine\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The Practice Routine</h3>\n<p>With that, I'm using <a href=\"https://www.guitarscientist.com/generator/pic/showpic.php?frb=KoAFAPAyfenQw5I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this</a> document as a way to practice. My routine is to listen to songs I enjoy in G Major or Em (the relative minor of G Major) and improvise vertically (as in, not moving my hand up or down the neck), and then incrementally move up frets (up the neck) while maintaining the same scale.</p>\n","date":"2020-04-09T16:18:31.582Z"}},"context":{}}
