The way it works is simple - all participants record covers of the same song. The covers are then compiled, and we can enjoy comparing everyone's take.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this project is to promote musical education, practice and community - </p>\n<h3 id=\"how-signup-works--\"><a href=\"#how-signup-works--\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How Signup Works -</h3>\n<p>If you want to participate, fill out the submission form with your name, email address and at least one song you'd like to cover. </p>\n<h3 id=\"how-song-selection-works--\"><a href=\"#how-song-selection-works--\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How Song Selection Works -</h3>\n<p>After song submission closes, all participants will fill out of poll with all submitted songs and their corresponding youtube links to listen to. Participants will rate the songs 1 to 5 on a scale of \"Definitely don't want to cover\" to \"I'm super down to cover this song.\"  Voting a 1 vetos the song - which is a valid move if you don't see the song as technically possible for you as a musician to pull off. The survey will also include the question \"In how many weeks should our cover submissions be due?\"</p>\n<h4 id=\"once-results-are-in-well-strive-to-make-the-most-fair-selection-via-the-following-rules--\"><a href=\"#once-results-are-in-well-strive-to-make-the-most-fair-selection-via-the-following-rules--\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Once results are in, we'll strive to make the most fair selection via the following rules -</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is a clear favorite that hasn't been vetoed, then that song will be chosen. </li>\n<li>If there are multiple popular songs without vetos, we will randomly choose one of them. </li>\n<li>\n<p>If there are no obvious winners, we will discuss as participants how to move forward - allowing discussion of current submissions as well as opening the pool back up for new songs. </p>\n<h4 id=\"vote-rubric\"><a href=\"#vote-rubric\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Vote Rubric</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Vote</th>\n<th>Significance</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Absolutely not</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>I'd rather not</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Sure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>I'd like to cover this</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>I'd REALLY like to cover this</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"how-song-submission-works--\"><a href=\"#how-song-submission-works--\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How Song Submission works -</h3>\n<p>We'll decide on a deadline, and all participants will submit a link to their cover on soundcloud by that deadline. I'll then publish a playlist with everyone's versions, which we'll all listen to together at a post-submission listening party. </p>\n<p>Thanks for being involved,</p>\n<p>Nate</p>\n","date":"2020-04-19T19:43:55.705Z"}},"context":{}}
