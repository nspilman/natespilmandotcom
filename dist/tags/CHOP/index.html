I'm going to highlight my key takeaways and experiences and let the photos do the rest of the talking. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere were way more people out and about at CHOP at noon on a Sunday than at 11 on a Friday. It felt like a summer festival, but with Black Lives Matter as the central theme.  There was a bubble blowing man, a jazz bluegrass band and a guy selling Black Lives Matter shirts and masks. The police precinct had a few new signs and looked a lot more put together. There was an Indigenous People's display telling Washington governor Inslee to defund fossil fuel projects. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI spotted Shirley - the black woman from the previous post who was concerned about lack of BLM organization at CHOP - organizing a workshop with a large group of black folks to identify mission and message. James from the previous post was also assisting in the organization. The workshop was considered \"Private\" and positioned itself down a long alleyway, since technically all of CHOP is out in the open. I spoke with the volunteers guarding the entrance - one of them with a James Baldwin novel on his lap - and experienced the following. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EA young white man was visibly angry. His black friend showed up, and per their conversation: someone was a jerk to the black guy, the white guy wanted to defend his friend and fight the guy, while the black friend wanted nothing to do with it. The white guy continued defending his rage and justification of violence in defense of his friend. I confirmed with the black volunteer that we just witnessed an example of a white ally wanting to help but not actually listening to the black person\u002Fpeople he's trying to help. \u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAn older white man exited the alley, appearing to have just walked through the workshop. He yelled a few swear words and gave them the middle finger before leaving the alley. Fortunately I didn't hear any racial slurs. \u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAnother older white man with an impressive zoom lens lined up in front of the alley to take photos of the workshop. For the safety of the volunteers, everyone in the area informed this man that this event was private and he shouldn't be taking photos. He responded, without putting his camera down, that this is \"public property and therefore this is his right.\" I stepped in front of his lens and said while this is true, we are respectfully asking him not to engage in this behavior. He responded by saying that we were infringing on his constitutional rights, and that we were all hypocrites for fighting for \"The very rights that you are now stripping me of.\" I asked him that if he did take any photos, to please blur out the faces. He responds \"Why do you think I'd listen to anything you have to say to me?\" \u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI also spoke with one of the volunteers of the No Cop Co-Op. I asked him how he got involved, and he said he showed up the day before and asked how he could help. He'd been working ever since, as he worked the night watch through the night, and was now making tomato soup for people. He also made reference to a person - \"Mama\" - who was a figure of authority. \"Mama told me to take watch of the co-op to ensure there wasn't any looting.\" I hope he's gotten some rest. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002FchopBusiness1.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002FchopBusiness2.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002FchopBus3.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop1.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop2.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop3.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop4.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop5.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop6.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop7.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop8.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop9.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop10.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop11.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop12.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop13.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop14.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop15.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop16.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop17.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop18.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop19.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop20.jpg\"\u003E \u003Cimg src=\"\u002Fuploads\u002Fchop21.jpg\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that the work week is back upon us, I probably won't be returning to CHOP until next weekend.

They responded along the lines of \"There is no leader, no organizer. We are but medics. You'll have to talk to someone else about demands and organization, but remember, there is no leader.\" One of the guys was fairly rude. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI spoke with this woman after the conversation, indicating that I appreciated her inquiry of basically \"now what?\" for the CHAZ movement.

She argued that real progress would need to be made via identifying a list of demands, and was concerned that CHAZ appeared leaderless. She was also concerned that   CHAZ was a distraction from the good work that BLM is doing, and that it was largely co-opted by white people.  James argued that although there was no top-down leadership in place, moves were being made with people in power in Seattle - and that while the there were a ton of white people around at CHAZ, it was 11am on a Friday, and not indicative of the area during an organized protest. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt this point at small crowd had formed - all white - including an ally of the black community running for Congress, and an older gentleman who told me he \"needed to spraypaint the windows of the police station black so when Trump orders the cops back, they can't see outside.\" Crazy Anarchist Man is an example of a white person co-opting the movement. I soon after learned that James was in his tent outside the precinct explicitly to play defense against Crazy Anarchist Man. When it was suggested \"We need a leader to present demands\" Crazy Anarchist Man responds that leaders were the problem. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA third black person showed up - we'll call him \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftheundefeated.com\u002Ffeatures\u002Fthe-undefeated-44-most-influential-black-americans-in-history\u002F#jesse-owens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003EJesse\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Jesse appeared to be in his early 20s (but who can tell with the masks), and shared in the opinion that the whole CHAZ project was another example of white people running away with their movement. Pretty soon there must have been a crowd of at least ten white folks listening to these three black folks speak. At one point a white lady in the crowd cut off the black woman mid-sentence to say \"I just want to let you know that I'm listening to you.\" completely missing the tragic irony of her statement. \"I'm here so I can broaden my experience and bring it back to my racist family members.\"  \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJesse responds \"No disrespect but I don't need white people to like me. You can hate me as much as you want as long as I know my rights.\" \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EShirley's main point was \"We need to take down the barriers, as barriers represent what black people have been running up against for years. The barriers are offensive. Taking down the barriers should be seen as an olive branch to the Seattle police department to make meaningful change happen.\" James responded that he and other black protestors saw the barriers as necessary to keep the violent police out, and not as a reminder of their oppression. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENear the end of the conversation, Shirley pointed to a \"BLM\" tag behind a chain linked fence and indicated how awful of an image that was.
