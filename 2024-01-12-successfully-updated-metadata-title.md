In [Blog Improvement Opportunities](2024-01-10-blog-improvement-opportunities) I outlined some items I wanted to tackle. Dynamically updating the metadata title is now complete! 

tThanks to [these docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata) and some trial and error, I made the change[ in this commit](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata). Now when I want to see my friends my post with some images I made, the url link that renders will include the title of the post.
